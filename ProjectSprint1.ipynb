      "I have complained many times that the credit reporting by Experian is inaccurate and they always just say wait awhile, it will be fixed later and yet it never is. They are incapable of providing accurate information and do not take responsibility for their errors. This is a fake service, designed to serve only their needs and not the consumer 's needs. I can not find any way to cancel and when I mention it on the phone I am immediately disconnected. \n",
      "I want to be a part of the class action lawsuit against them since they are responsible for reducing my credit rating, releasing my personal information and my fraud complaints have multiplied over the last 2-3 years. I have spoken to many ineffectual and uncaring agents on their phone support lines and am just tired of paying them to degrade my credit for random incorrect reasons ( like I paid a utility bill with another bank account ) and not raising it for legitimate things like paying off thousands of dollars of debt, getting 3 new credit cards with {$9000.00} dollars in new credit available. This company should not even be allowed to report credit since they have no idea what is worthy and what is not. I suggest the federal government just shut them down since they can not even keep our data secure!\n",
